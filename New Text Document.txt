🛒 Retail Sales Predictor
This project aims to predict the sales of products across various retail outlets using machine learning. By analyzing past sales data and outlet characteristics, we trained a regression model that forecasts sales — helping improve inventory management, marketing, and operational decisions.

📌 Project Overview
Dataset: Big Mart sales dataset with 8523 training records and 5681 test records.

Goal: Predict Item_Outlet_Sales for products in different stores using product and outlet features.

Model Used: XGBoost Regressor (gradient boosting technique suitable for tabular data).

🧑‍💻 Features Used
Product-related features:

Item_Weight

Item_Fat_Content

Item_Visibility

Item_Type

Item_MRP

Outlet-related features:

Outlet_Size

Outlet_Location_Type

Outlet_Type

Outlet_Establishment_Year → transformed into a new feature Outlet_Age

🔧 All categorical variables were encoded using Label Encoding. Missing values were handled appropriately.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values (Item_Weight, Outlet_Size)

Created a new feature: Outlet_Age

Removed non-useful identifiers like Item_Identifier and Outlet_Identifier

Label encoded categorical columns

Model Training:

Trained on XGBoost Regressor

Train-validation split (75:25)

Evaluated using R² Score

Evaluation Results:

Training R² Score: ~0.80

Validation R² Score: ~0.53–0.60

Added feature engineering to reduce overfitting

Prediction:
